# Customer_Segmentation
Customer segmentation analysis using the K-Means clustering algorithm is a data analysis technique that involves grouping customers into distinct clusters based on their similarities in certain features observed in our dataset like gender, annual-income and spending score .
it correctly defines market basket analysis 
# market-basket analysis 
Market Basket Analysis is a data analysis technique used in retail and other industries to identify relationships between products that customers tend to purchase together. The goal is to uncover patterns and associations in customer buying behavior by analyzing transactions and identifying items frequently bought in combination

# k-means clustering algorithm and using elbow method and euclidiean distance
The K-Means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets or clusters. Each data point in the dataset is assigned to one of the clusters based on the similarity of its features. K represents the predetermined number of clusters, and the algorithm works to group data points into clusters such that the sum of squared distances from the data points to their assigned cluster centroids is minimized.

The Elbow Point method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K) in K-Means clustering.

Run K-Means: Execute the K-Means algorithm for a range of K values.
Calculate Sum of Squared Errors (SSE): For each K, compute the sum of squared distances between each point and its assigned centroid.
Plot SSE vs. K: Create a plot of SSE against the number of clusters (K).
Identify Elbow Point: Look for the "elbow" in the plot, where the rate of decrease in SSE sharply changes. The point at which the curve starts to flatten is considered the optimal K.
Euclidiean distance:
Euclidean distance is the measure of the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. In K-Means clustering, it is used to calculate the distance between data points and centroids
